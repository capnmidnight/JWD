        <h1>What have I been doing since the Galapagos?</h1>
        <p>Waking up in the morning and yelling “don’t be a piece of shit!”
        And then sobbing into a bowl of Rice Krispies.</p>
        <p><em>Mostly</em> not true.</p>
        <p>My attitude towards work has been better. Though, it took first
        getting over the initial disappointment of being back in a frozen
        wasteland that doubles as a hellish swamp in the summer and a cesspool
        of political corruption at all other times.</p>
        <p>Not sure if I ever said [1], but the trip was paradise.</p>
        <p>But yearning for keeping a mockingbird as a walking pet doesn’t get
        me anywhere but eating a sausage egg and cheese biscuit at 10:35am, with
        greasy hair, 3 days’ stubble, a week-old pajamas.</p>
        <p>I’ve been striving to improve my writing—less verbose, more direct
        and graphic. I’ve “mathematically proven in my head” that programming is
        the wrong path for me, long term. Short of doing something completely
        out of character like going to grad school for an MBA, the available
        paths out all seem to include becoming an excellent writer. I know I’m a
        much better writer than I was ten years, five years, and even a year
        ago now. I think I could be better.</p>
        <p>A lot of this productivity feels like only activity, though. But it’s
        not clear what other things I would do that would create actual
        progress. Sometimes you have to unwind the stack before you can get any
        further down the road. What a particularly egregious mixed metaphor. I
        need to learn a new way to work. It’s probably aspects we’ve talked
        about before, but I need to revisit them in earnest.</p>
        <p>Steady, daily progress over spurts of brilliance is what I think I
        want. “The Book” was a weird experience. It feels like nothing. It is
        nothing. But it is also not nothing. It’s a quantum superposition that I
        can’t wrap my head around yet. Maybe just being active right now is the
        best thing, to practice steady progress.</p>
        <p>Trying not to be a piece of shit. That could be my new motto.</p>
        <p>[1] This is what we call a “turn of phrase”, or in other words, “a lie”.
        I know for certain that I did.</p>
