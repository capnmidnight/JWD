This is "Just Write, Dammit!" As in, that's all you can do when you use it. As in, put Twitter/Facebook/G+/Farmville/etc. down and just write, dammit. It is a distraction-free writing program that syncs your writing across devices. On desktop computers and smartphones, the minimalist, fullscreen layout helps focus the writer on long writing sessions. Read more about the motivations leading to "Just Write, Dammit".

With your support, we can make JWD even more. Be able to management multiple book-writing projects at the same time. Apply basic formatting and export to the ePub for direct publishing. Text analysis algorithms for honing the writing. And creativity-stimulating minigames that serve to stimulate the writer out of writer's-block or teach us better writing habits. You can check out JWD's issues list on GitHub to see more of where JWD is going.

So what the hell are you doing? Get to work!
